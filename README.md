- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RobertaReis79
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Data Visualization Tools and Web scraping techniques. Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science foundations to collaborate on Costumer experience analyses.
- This special project's objectives are:
  1.	To get hands-on practice with GitHub, understanding data, team collaboration, and planning data preprocessing tasks.
  2.	To experiment with Jupyter Notebook and practice creating Markdown cells.
